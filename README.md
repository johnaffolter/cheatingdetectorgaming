Detect Cheating in game
By analyzing the graph data with the given algorithm, the application can find patterns in multi-hop instances. It works by iteratively creating absorbers, which are sets of nodes that have a triangle relationship. The iterative absorption algorithm breaks down the absorber into smaller triangles and uses the edges from those triangles to create new absorbers, continuing the process until no more triangles can be formed. This allows the algorithm to identify deep multi-hop connections between players and their networks, potentially revealing organized cheating or other suspicious patterns.

In the context of the specific games mentioned earlier, the graph analysis can be tailored to each game by adjusting the types of data and relationships represented in the graph. For example, in OverWatch, the graph could include nodes for players, heroes, and matches, with edges representing player-to-player interactions,hero usage, and match outcomes. By examining multi-hop relationships in the graph, the algorithm can identify potential cheating patterns such as groups of players who consistently perform exceptionally well together or players who have unusual success with specific heroes.

Similarly, in World of Warcraft, the graph can be constructed with nodes for players, characters, items, and in-game events, with edges representing player-to-player interactions, character leveling, and item acquisition. Multi-hop analysis can help identify potential botters, gold farmers, or exploit users by examining relationships between players who level up too quickly, accumulate resources at an unnatural pace, or trade items in suspicious patterns.

In Hearthstone, the graph can be constructed using nodes for players, matches, decks, and cards, with edges representing player-to-player interactions, match outcomes, and deck compositions. The multi-hop analysis can help identify potential win-rate manipulation, match-fixing, or external tool usage by examining patterns of game outcomes, deck usage, and interactions with specific opponents.

For Diablo, the graph can be built with nodes for players, characters, items, and in-game events such as monster kills and dungeon completions. Edges can represent player-to-player interactions, character progression, item acquisition, and trading. Multi-hop analysis can identify potential item duplication, account sharing, or botting by examining relationships between players who progress too quickly, acquire rare items too easily, or trade items in an unusual manner.

In StarCraft, the graph can be constructed using nodes for players, matches, units, and resources, with edges representing player-to-player interactions, match outcomes, unit production, and resource management. Multi-hop analysis can help identify potential automation, macro usage, or match-fixing by examining patterns of player APM, unit production, and resource management, as well as interactions with specific opponents.

To further enhance the graph analysis for each game, additional data points and relationships can be incorporated, such as in-game communication, social network connections, and historical player behavior. This can provide a richer understanding of the connections between players and their networks, allowing the algorithm to identify more subtle patterns and connections that may indicate organized cheating or other fraudulent activities.

Additionally, the graph analysis can be combined with other machine learning techniques, such as supervised learning for classification tasks or unsupervised learning for anomaly detection. By training models on labeled data, the system can learn to recognize patterns and behaviors associated with cheating and flag suspicious players for further investigation.

Incorporating feedback loops can also help improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the system over time. As players are flagged and investigated for potential cheating, the results of these investigations can be fed back into the system to refine the models and algorithms. This can help the system adapt to new cheating methods and techniques, ensuring that it remains effective at detecting and preventing cheating in the long term.
