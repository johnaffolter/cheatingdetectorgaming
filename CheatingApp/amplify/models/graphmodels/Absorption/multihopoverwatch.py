##This example query finds groups of three players (player1, player2, player3) who consistently perform well together. 
# You can modify the query according to the specific analysis requirements for each game. 
# Further refine the analysis by incorporating additional data points and relationships such as
# in-game communication, social network connections, and historical player behavior, providing a richer understanding of connections between players and their networks.
